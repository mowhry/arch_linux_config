# Arch_Linux Personnal Configuration

Here's my personal configuration for my Linux arch and the installation tutorial.

## Installation guide

First, you need to install Arch_Linux. To do this, download the .iso from https://archlinux.org/download/

then either you want to install it on a PC, for which you'll need a bootable usb key, and I recommend the balena etcher software (https://etcher.balena.io)
otherwise a simple computer will be enough.

### Installing Arch_Linux

Here's the 1st thing you see when you boot Arch.
